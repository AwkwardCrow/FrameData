- take the angular code school courses tomorrow
- create a front end (very bare bones) that calls the API I created
  - add/get Games
  - add/get Characters
  - add/get Moves
- display data in a decent format


- learn how to do a sizeable dumb of data to the database for games, characters, and moves w/frame data so I can initialize it

okay, so now that ive jumped into angular, i should create a basic page for the webapp

index.html
filter box at the top of the page

basic list of games available
  - these will be buttons populated from the api call getGames
  - when selected
    - load characters page
    - populate with information from the api call getCharacters, with the optional 'games' parameter based on the button clicked


- so basically i just need to code some iterative elements using ng-repeat,
- separate it out into their own html pages so i can just include them on the one page
- make the controller reach out to the API to grab based on a filter (start with just grabbing all)

- this shouldn't be too hard, can probably start working on this tonight after the gym

- create an html for each "class", the games, charcters, and Moves
- each of these xmls will contain a div and contain the ng-repeat directive to loop
- it will be one index.html and each of these pages will just update the view
- the code that calls the api will be in the .js behind the scenes, which will contain the directives and controllers
